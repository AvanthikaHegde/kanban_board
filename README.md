# kanban_board
A simple Kanban Board for scrum management
I would work on its UI and try making it in a tabular form instead of list.



#Solitaire
Since the main logic of the game is just having different colours,but consecutive numbers between adjacent cards i would probably use the if/else logic and implement that.
i would enhance my skills in tkinter and explore on how to make its UI  more intuitive.
